    title: Generate the Geometry file for CATFLOW via Hillslope Delineation
    description: |
      Generates all required raster layers and creates a representative hillslope geometry file 
      for CATFLOW modeling using [Whitebox GIS](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/) and the 
      Loritz et al. (2017) method. This tool workflow combines stream thresholding and hillslope delineation
      with geometry generation in a single workflow.
      
      Step 1: Generates necessary raster layers using a DEM and stream threshold.  
      Step 2: Uses the generated raster layers to construct the representative hillslope geometry file.
